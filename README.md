# stack-queue-palindrome

Queue: Queue container simulates a buffer.

At the start of simulation, user is prompted for the following information:

1. How many rounds will be simulated.

2. The percentage chance to put a randomly generated number at the end of buffer.

3. The percentage chance to take out a randomly generated number at the front of buffer.

Once all the user input is validated and stored in variables, the buffer simulation will start.


Stack:

Creates a palindrome, which is a string that is the same forwards and backwards.
